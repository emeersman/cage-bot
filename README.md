This is a custom Slack bot written to be integrated into a team chat. The best functionality of the bot is the ability to display random images of Nicolas Cage. When the user asks the bot (named @cage) "@cage image me X", the bot will search Google for images relating to Nicolas Cage and X. A random image from this search will be displayed in the chat.
